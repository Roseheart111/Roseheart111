<p>My name is Laura Orozco as I am a 17 years old TPAA student. I was raised and born in Palmdale, CA with my mom, my sister Sabrina, and my three brothers Robert, Mauricio, and Ivan, along with my puppy Frosty.</p>
<p>I am known to be an adventous, curious, and hardworking person. However, I'm also a bit crazy, very funny, and an awesome fam to my friends. Heck my friends gave me nicknames such as LauraLamb, Short Child #1, LalaLamb, Shorty, etc. Overall LauraLamb, sometimes lamb for short, has grown onto me and I very much acttualy like the name as it makes me feel more unique and special.</p>
